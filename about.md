# The Urge to Connect and Record
Welcome! This space is the direct result of an urge — an itch, really — to establish a public repository for my own thoughts, studies, and continuous growth. I believe that the act of writing, organizing, and sharing ideas is the most powerful way to solidify learning and prompt further discovery.

This isn't just a portfolio; it's a living document of my journey. You'll find my unfiltered insights, roadblocks, and triumphs as I navigate the world of curiosity.

# Who Am I?
I am **Paulo Sérgio**, and I am a Data Engineer with a foundational background in Electrical Engineering.
I am graduated from FEEC/UNICAMP (2016-2021). My journey began with a deep, lifelong passion for mathematics and problem-solving.

At some point, my path intersected with the world of Data Engineering, and I immediately fell in love. I found that the complex, architectural challenges of building robust and efficient data pipelines perfectly align with my engineering mindset and my passion for logical systems. Today, I use that enthusiasm to dig into the world of data, focusing on how fundamental mathematical models drive modern algorithms and data intelligence.
